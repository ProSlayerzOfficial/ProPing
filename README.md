# ProPing
Ping Optimization Mod For Minecraft 1.21.1
**How It Works**
ProPing optimizes ping on low/high lag servers by clearing entities and fixing the areas that surround the player. This mod makes it so that the player can enjoy a seamlessly lag free area and will hopefully keep the player under 100ms on cross-region servers. It speeds the processing of packets up so that the players can actually enjoy the server they play as it will run properly and makes the experience of Minecraft More enjoyable!
